I go to this school where our teachers are mostly nuns — we have to go to church every week, and sometimes I'll bark in church too. This one nun, Sister Agatha, told me that Jesus didn't appreciate mebarking like that in church and disruptingeverything. She's mean though —  it's funny there's always thatquestion about nuns — "is she mean?" — that everyone's always talkin' about — whenever you find out whoyour teachers will be for the next year, it's always how mean Sister so and so is, and how this one cuts your hair when you're not looking if it grows too long, and how another one will ask you to hold your palmsout so she can smack 'em with a ruler. My brother told me all kinds of horrible stuff about every nun I was go—a' have — but with Sister Agatha, he wasn't kidding. Yesterday, after telling me all about how Jesus didn't appreciate me disrupting His Mass, she smacked me in the back of the head, and told me maybe that will stop me from shaking it.
