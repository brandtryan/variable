When we get to the hospital I have to sit in this waiting room that is made for little kids — there is a box of toys and a pile of children's books. I'm gettin' sorta' nervous though, because my mom says I might have this disease, and I don't want to have it — I figure that if I can stop twitching while I'm with the doctor, that he won't think I have it. I mean, I don't really care if I have it — but my mom, she gets all worried about it, like that one time she even cried when my teachers at school said they might take further action — and there's one thing in the world that I can't stand, and that's my mom crying. It's like I have to cry just because my mom's crying — I don't even have to know what it's about — I start in right along with her, and ask her why she has to bawl when she knows it makes me sad.
