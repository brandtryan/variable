And I'm thinking, yeah, like this isn't a test. This guy is trying to make me do something, but it's like the urges are starting to calm down a bit, and so I walk real cool like down to the drinking fountain, and feel the eyes of that doctor on my back watching me like a hawk. When I return without making a single jerk, I'm smiling like I'm in on his secret test, and he tells me I can go home now.
