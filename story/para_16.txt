Luckily there's no one else in the room — I mean, if there was a little kid in the room I'd really be feelin' stupid — 'cause sometimes little kids look at me and then go over to their mom like they're afraid of me or somethin'. The urges are coming from all over, and I can't remember when I've been so bad with it —  but then the doctor comes in and introduces himself to me, and not to my mom, which I think is sorta' weird since she is right there next to me. Adults are always doin' weird stuff like that when I'm around. They're always taking me aside and asking "How are you,  Brandt? Is everything okay?" like I'm some kind of retard or something. Not that I have anything against retards, but it's like I'm not retarded — I just twitch and stuff, which isn't the same thing at all. Just like Crazy Charlie really isn't crazy.
