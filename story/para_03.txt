I figured though, that Jesus didn't mind so much — since I prayed to Him all the time to help me to stopshaking my head, and barking, though it never seemed to help. The way I see it, if He didn't want to help,then He probably didn't care too much if I did it in church. Sister Agatha and the rest of the teachers told my mom that I was forever disrupting the classes and Masses, and that they were thinking of taking further action if I didn't stop, whatever that's supposed to mean. What they were going to do I don't know — but my mom thought something was wrong with me anyway, especially after this one time when Icalled my basketball coach an asshole right to his face for taking me outta' the game.
