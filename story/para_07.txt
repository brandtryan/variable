Anyway, it was Crazy Charlie that got me goin' makin' all these weird noises â€” 'cause before that I never did anything. I started makin' fun of him like everyone else, and then one time he looked at me, like I was the one who started all of it, and barked right at me. Well, the only thing I could do was bark right back, and when I did, my friends all laughed real hard, and patted me on the back like it was a real good one or somethin'.
