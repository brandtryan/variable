Rivi is the name of the pool we all go to, and I spend most of my summers there, except when I'm at camp. It's like five pools all in one, 'cause there are special parts of the pool for different types of things. There's a bullpen, which is my favorite, where only boys are allowed. If a girl gets caught in there, she gets thrown out, and can't come back for a day. Then there's the six foot where all the codgers and old ladies do laps — the jackbox where most of the girls hang out 'cause there's a bar there where they can do somersaults and stuff — and finally a baby and toddler pool which, rumor has it, is two parts water, and one part urine.
