So anyway, I'm not a cry baby or anything â€” it's just that one thing that does it to me every time. So I'm thinking I'll hold in the urges to bark and twitch for at least a few minutes while the doctor's seein' me. That way he won't think I have it, and my mom won't have anything to get all worked up about.
