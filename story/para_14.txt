That's the thing about it — it's like once you start in on it, you've got to get it right. Just like Crazy Charlie and his Olympic dives — if it's off by just a little bit, you've got to do it again. Especially with the barks — at first everyone can barely hear it, but then I think that they didn't hear it, and so I have to do it again — but then I think that surely they didn't hear that one either, and so on until the whole class is staring at me, and I'm yanked outta' the class by Sister Agatha and sent to the principal's office.
