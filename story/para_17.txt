The doctor asks me to follow him down the hall to his office where we can talk, and I'm waiting for my mom to come with us, but she stays behind. The doctor tells me he just wants to talk to me for a minute. We're walking down the hall and I'm really about to explode, 'cause it's like there's all this energy going through me like I've just been electrocuted â€” not that I've ever been electrocuted before, but I'm thinking this is what it would feel like if I was. I'm sweating by the time we make it to his office, which is like ten miles down the hall, and he asks me again if everything's all right.
