At first it was all a big joke — because there was this one guy at the swimming pool — Crazy Charlie — who would bark right before he dove off the high dive and into the tank. He was an old man, and he would do that same damn dive every time, like he was trying out for the Olympics or something — but every time his bony hands would hit the water palms up, and his one leg never seemed to be in line with the other one. Then he'd go up the ladder doing these weird twitches, stand at the end of the board, let out a bark, and then dive again. It wasn't like a little bark either — it was a loud bark, and everyone always heard it and would look up at his old ass getting ready to dive, and laugh. We imitated him a lot, walking around all the different parts of the pool, barking and twitching, and yelling out "Crazy Charlie!" 'cause a lot of times,Crazy Charlie himself would do that while he was walking from the showers to the diving tank.
