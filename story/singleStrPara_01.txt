My teachers look at me funny when I make weird noises, but my friends, they usually just laugh. It's funny to them, and they are pretty cool about it — they don't make fun of me really, but only get a kick out of it — like when we are in the middle of a test or something, and then out of nowhere I let out a bark, I mean a loud bark, where everyone turns around to me and smiles, and then someone starts laughing, and then everyone else gets going. To tell you the truth, it doesn't bother me at all, and I laugh right along with them most of the time.
