In the bullpen there's this big guy that likes to launch me into the air like a missile. That's what they call me and my friends, missiles, 'cause they take one of our feet in their cupped hands, and launch us through the air to see how high they can throw us. Abe is the best launcher — he's the biggest human being I've ever seen, and when he launches me, I can see over the fence of the club all the way to the steeple of Meridian Street Methodist Church. My friends don't believe me, but it's true — I mean, it's not like I can prove it or anything — but I can see the steeple, and the Baskin Robbins sign right over the canal behind Rivi. I'm probably the lightest one out of all my friends, and that's why I go the highest. The funny thing is though, whenever I'm a missile, I never get the urge to twitch or bark — I guess it's just becauseI'm too busy worrying about the flips and somersaults that I'm gonna' do — one time when Abe launched me I did three somersaults before I straightened out for a perfect dive into the water. I'm thinking I'll tell this to that doctor I'm gonna' see today, since that is practically the only time that I don't do it.
