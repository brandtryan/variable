On the way to Riley Hospital my mom keeps tellin' me that it's not a psychiatrist that I'm gonna' see — but that it's a neurologist, whatever that's supposed to be. She knows that I don't like crazy people — and that they are the only people that really scare me — more than the weird things I hear in my room at night, when I'm praying to Jesus to protect me from them. I remember I used to be real scared of them when I was little, until I got my first communion at church. After that I figured I was off limits to the monsters since I ate holy wafers on a weekly basis. But Crazy Charlie doesn't count as a crazy person to me — because it's not like he's a psycho or anything — he just does funny twitches and weird noises — not like the guys downtown who talk to themselves and look like they're about to kill somebody or somethin'. Those guys are creeps, and I try to keep clear of them whenever me and my mom go downtown to the post office.
