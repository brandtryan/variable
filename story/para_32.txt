On the way home I ask her if I have the barks, and what the doctor had said about me. She tells me that I do have them and that we're goin' to the pharmacy to get some medicine that'll make it all better. I turn toface her and tell her that I hadn't budged during the whole test, that I knew about the test, and that I hadn't done anything at all. Then she starts to cry, tears running down to the corners of her mouth, and she starts rubbing the back of my neck.
