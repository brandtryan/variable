The thing that I remember, though, is when Crazy Charlie was lookin' at me — it was like he musta' been thinking of how either he hoped we all got the barks so that we would stop laughing, or that maybe he was hopin' that we would never get 'em, because it seemed to bother him a lot. Ever since that day I've been doin' the barks and twitches a lot, and I think maybe he gave 'em to me when he looked right at me and I barked back at him. My mom says that's ridiculous, but she wasn't there to see the look Crazy Charlie gave me. It wasn't like an adult look — it was the look some kid gives you after you've made fun of him, like he really hates you, and would like to kill you right there on the spot.
