But in the waiting room I'm really going at it since the doctor's nowhere in sight — I pick up this book I remember having when I was a kid, The Cat In The Hat, and start reading it to get my mind off the wholesituation. Only the urges are really coming at me now, since I've got this great plan to hold 'em all in whenthe doctor shows up. I'm flipping my head back and forth, and can barely even read — I'm stomping my feet, trying to get my toes through the soles of my shoes. If I could, I'd curl my toes right through the carpet and into the floor underneath. I'm grunting every other second, louder each time, and can't seem to get it right.
